Former recentern.vim
Inspired by vimscript #1228

Recent.vim keeps track of files you have _written_ recently.  This is useful
to continue work on files that are scattered around the file system.

The list of filenames is persistently stored in ~/.vim/recent_files

Per default, the filelist shows up at startup if no other file (or session) is loaded.
Also a menu with commands gets installed.  You can turn these things off.

To open a file of the list, several commands and options are provided to make
use of windows and tabpages.

Details can be found in the help file.

Misc:
- if there is a window for a file, it is always reused (first one found in
  any tabpage), currently not customizable
- files can be ignored based on autocmd-pattern
- filenames can be highlighted based on extension
- the file list is only updated when necessary
